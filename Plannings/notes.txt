sending a message to a chat completion model

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
	model = "chat completion model name"
	messages = [
	{"role" : "system", "content" : "tell the chat bot the role to be played by chat bot for preferably teacher for this project"},
	{"role" : "teacher", "content" : "A message you expect the bot to think it said to the student"},
	{"role" : "student", "content" : "user prompt to chatbot"}
]
)

When a message is sent to a chat completion model it returns this
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-123",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "created": 1677652288,
  "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
  "choices": [{
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "role": "Teacher",
      "content": "\n\nHello there, how may I assist you today?",
    },
    "finish_reason": "stop"
  }],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 9,
    "completion_tokens": 12,
    "total_tokens": 21
  }
}

to retrive response
response = dict(completion.choices[0].message)
now response.content returns the expected response from the chatbot
